For animations there are two tabs 
	1) KeyFrame Editor - lets the user create key frames for an animation and edit current key frames.
	2) Animator mode - lets the user select a number of frames then create an animation based off of those frames and key frames.
	The user can then use the play button to play the animation. The play button also doubles as a pause button once clicked (the text of the button will change).
	The stop button stops the play back and resets the starting point. The pause button stops the playback and begins it where it left off. The text that first says:
	"None selected" updates based on the current frame being played or that is selected in the animation (via the slider). If the slider is a keyFrame (from the Keyframe editor)
	it will say 'Key Frame Selected' otherwise it will say 'Animation Frame Selected'. The slider updates to show the progress of the animation while it is being played.
	The user can also drag the slider to view each individual frame that is present in the animation. They then can select the 'Make KeyFrame' button to convert the frame to a keyFrame
	and it will then appear as a key frame in the 'Key Frame Editor' and the user can then edit it.

Extra Credit:
	-Variable PlayBack Speed- the user can adjust the playback speed of the animation either while the animation is playing or while it is stopped/paused.
	-Looping: the user can loop the animation during the animation's playback or before starting playback using the Loop checkbox. 

Bugs:
	-Currently no known bugs.
	-(All bugs from previous HWs have been corrected.)



FUN ASSIGNMENT YAY :D! I feel accomplished! Now on to 3D!
